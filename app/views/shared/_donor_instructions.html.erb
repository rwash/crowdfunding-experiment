<h2>Crowdfunding Experiment - Project Donor</h2>       
<br>

<p>In this study you will play the role of a Donor on a crowdfunding website. Crowdfunding sites are websites where people can post projects and ask for small donations from a large number of people over the Internet.</p>

<p>You will be taken to a simulated crowdfunding website where project creators have created 3 projects soliciting funding. Each project requires 100 credits. You will be given <strong><%= AMOUNT_DONOR_CAN_DONATE_PER_ROUND %></strong> credits that you may donate to projects. You can donate up to 30 credits to each project, but you may choose not to donate any credits as well.</p>

<p>A round lasts <%= ROUND_PART_B_COUNTDOWN_SECONDS %> seconds. You may donate at any time during the round. You may also make multiple donations. As soon as you make a donation, all others in your group will see the total amount each project has received. </p>
                                                                                                                            
<p>Each project will list a payoff that you will earn of that project is completed and receives its requested donations. In this simulation, you will earn payoffs for every project that is fully funded, <strong>regardless of whether you donated to that project yourself.</strong> There are <strong><%= NUMBER_OF_DONORS_PER_GROUP %></strong> donors in your group, including yourself, who also earn payouts for when projects are funded. However, the other donorsâ€™ payouts may be different from your own payouts, so others will not necessarily prefer the same projects as you. Below is a picture of the interface you will use to make your donations:</p>

<h3>Payout Calculation:</h3>
<br>
<% if current_experiment.return_credits %>

	<p>If you donate to a project and that project does not receive enough donations to be completed, your donation will be returned to you. However, if a project receives excess donations, the excess donations are not returned to you.</p>
	
	<p>Your total payout for the simulation is: <strong>(Credits not donated to projects + Earnings from successful projects + Returned credits from not funded projects.)</strong>.</p>     
                                                                                         
<% else %>

	<p>All donations are final. If you make a donation to a project and it does not receive enough donations to be completed, the donations are kept by the website. If a project receives excess donations, those donations are also kept by the website and not returned to you.</p>
	
	<p>Your total payout for the simulation is: <strong>(Credits not donated to projects + Earnings from successful projects.)</strong>.</p>

<h3>Additional Instructions:</h3>
<br>      
<p> - You will play <strong><%= NUMBER_OF_PRACTICE_ROUNDS %></strong> practice rounds and <strong><%= NUMBER_OF_LIVE_ROUNDS %></strong> live rounds of this simulation. In each round, you will play with  a different set of people. You will not know who else you are playing with.</p>    

<p> - In each round, the credits you earn will be added to a running total. At the end of the experiment, your credits will be exchanged for cash at a rate of (<strong><%= CREDITS_TO_DOLLAR_RATE %> credits for $1</strong>).</p>
